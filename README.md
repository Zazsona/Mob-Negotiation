Mob Negotiation is a plugin inspired by the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series, allowing mobs to bargain for their lives. Catch them alone and put them in a tight spot, and they may approach you in desperation. You can demand buffs, items, or even cash if [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) is installed. Know they won't give over their treasures so easily, however. You'll need to convince them to hand over their riches through engaging in conversion and forming bonds with them by playing to their different personalities. The better you do the more they can potentially give, but know that if you say something that displeases them, they can just as soon retaliate...

Alternatively, if you're not looking to build your riches, you can opt for an All Out Attack to wipe them out instantly in spectacular style. They'll never see it coming.
